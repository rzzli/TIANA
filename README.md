# tnasa
Transcription Factor Network Analysis with Self-Attention (tnasa) is a deep learning based method to derive transcription factor(TF) interaction networks from self-attention attribution scores. Through tracking the gradients inside the CNN-attention deep learning framework, tnasa enables interpertation of the TF interactions that are essential in regulatory regions 

Graphical overview of the method:
